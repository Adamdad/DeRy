> In this work, we explore a novel knowledge-transfer task, termed as Deep Model Reassembly (*DeRy*), for general-purpose model reuse. *DeRy* first dissect each model into distinctive building blocks, and then selectively reassemble the derived blocks to produce customized networks under both the hardware resource and performance constraints.

## üõ† Installation
The model training part is based on [mmclassification](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification). Some of the pre-trained weights are from [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/tree/master/timm).

    # Create python env
    conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.8 pytorch=1.10 cudatoolkit=11.3 torchvision -c pytorch -y
    conda activate open-mmlab

    # Install mmcv and mmcls
    pip3 install openmim
    mim install mmcv-full==1.4.8
    mim install mmcls==0.18.0

    # Install timm
    pip3 install timm

**Note**: Our code needs `torch.fx` to support the computational graph extraction from the torch model. Therefore, please install the `torch > 1.10`.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To run the code for *DeRy, we need to go through 4 steps

1. [**Model Zoo Preparation**] Compute the model feature embeddings and representation similarity. We first write model configuration and its weight path, and run the configs in `configs/compute_sim`
            
        PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python simlarity/get_rep.py \
        $Config_file \              # configs in `configs/compute_sim`
        --out $Feature_path \       # Save feature embeddings in *.pth* files
        [--checkpoint $Checkpoint]  # download checkpoint if any

    All feature embeddings need to be saved in *.pth* files in the same $Feat_dictionary. We then load them and compute the feature similarity. Similarity will be saved as *net1.net2.pkl* files.

        PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python simlarity/compute_sim.py /
        --feat_path $Feat_dictionary /
        --sim_func $Similarity_function [cka, rbf_cka, lr]

    Pre-computed similarity on ImageNet for [Linear CKA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ebSVwZyKeHdmdOdVlFZF6P9_1PzEMs-J?usp=share_link) and [Linear Regression](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rKmV3iQwETKBO3yYlsXFIxrPfAc7VRRb?usp=share_link).

    We also need to compute the feature size (input-output feature dimensions). It can be done by running

        PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python simlarity/count_inout_size.py /
        --root $Feat_dictionary

    The results is a json file containing the input-output shape for all network layers, like [MODEL_INOUT_SHAPE.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15xDgYOu8Gs866faNHEYI0iHCJkxl-M2h/view?usp=share_link).

2. [**Network Partition**] Solve the cover set optimization to get the network partition. The results is an assignment file in *.pkl*.

        PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python simlarity/partition.py /
        --sim_path $Feat_similarity_path /
        --K        $Num_partition /             # default=4
        --trial    $Num_repeat_runs /           # default=200
        --eps      $Size_ratio_each_block /     # default=0.2
        --num_iter $Maximum_num_iter_eachrun    # default=200

3. [**Reassemby**] Reassemble the partitioned building blocks into a full model, by solving a integer program with training-free proxy. The results are a series of model configs in *.py*.

        PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python simlarity/zeroshot_reassembly.py \
        --path          $Block_partition_file [Saved in the partition step] \
        --C             $Maximum_parameter_num \
        --minC          $Minimum_parameter_num \
        --flop_C        $Maximum_FLOPs_num \
        --minflop_C     $Minimum_FLOPs_num \
        --num_batch     $Number_batch_average_to_compute_score \
        --batch_size    $Number_sample_each_batch \
        --trial         $Search_time \
        --zero_proxy    $Type_train_free_proxy [Default NASWOT] \
        --data_config   $Config_target_data

4. [**Fune-tuning**] Train the reassembled model on target data. You may refers to [mmclassification](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification) for the model training.

**Note**: Partitioning and reassembling results may not be identical because of the algorithmatic stochaticity. It may slightly affect the performance.
