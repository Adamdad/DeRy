**Deep Model Reassembly**

*Submitted to NeurIPS 2022*

In this work, we explore a novel knowledge-transfer task, termed as Deep Model Reassembly (*DeRy*), for general-purpose model reuse. *DeRy* first dissect each model into distinctive building blocks, and then selectively reassemble the derived blocks to produce customized networks under both the hardware resource and performance constraints.
